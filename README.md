A program made to read the logfiles generated by Keysight ICTs. (Specifically, the i3070 series.)

- automatically check for new logfiles,
- organizing the older logs into subfolders,
- reports the yield, with either as a single PCB or as a multiboard/panel basis,
- lists the failed tests,
- export: saves the test results in xlsx format, with multiple settings available,
- hourly: reports the throughput of the machine on a hourly basis,
- plotting: draws a graph of the selected test,
- scanning: scan the ICTs board directory for changes,

# TODO:

- Localization. 
- Export format improvements.
- Performance improvements when working with large datasets. (10k+ logfiles)
- Add option to filter the failurelist on a product type basis.
